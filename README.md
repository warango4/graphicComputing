# Graphic Computing

## First Challenge - DDA / Bresenham algorithms
- To run the first challenge, please clone the repo and go to ``lineDrawing`` folder, then type

    ``$ gcc lineDrawing.cpp -o lineDrawing -lGL -lGLU -lglut -lm``
    
    ``$ ./lineDrawing``

    This draws lines with both algorithms, DDA and Bresenham. You will see lines in red and blue. 
    
    Blue is for DDA line and red for Bresenham line. 

    To use it, you just have to press your mouse twice: first for the point where you want the line to begin and second for the point where you want the line to end.
